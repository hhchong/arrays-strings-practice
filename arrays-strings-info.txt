HASH TABLES: 

    Worst case runtime with lots of collisions is O(N), but good implementation is O(1)

    A word -> hash code -> an index in an array (done with hash(key) % len(array)) -> linked list at the index, for collision resolution

LISTS:

    Lists in python are dynamic, resizing (append, pop) is O(1). Insertion is O(n)
